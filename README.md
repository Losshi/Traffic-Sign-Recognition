# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

The title of the project is Traffic Sign Recognition using Capsule Networks. 

This project is done as an hybrid model by combining both Capsule Network model and Convolutional Neural Networks model for gaining more accuracy and better performance.

The testing is done using a Graphical User Interface where images can be uploaded.
The uploaded images are given as input to both the models.
Finally, the predicted outputs from both the models are compared and the result is displayed as a message to the driver with different colors for guarantee and assurance of the predicted recognition.

The code for the GUI and the training and testing dataset preparation is added in this repository. Other necessary codes are given as Google Colab links.

THANK YOU :)
